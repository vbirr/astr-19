This is the final project for ASTR 19 at UCSC. 

We went through the sep tutorial and went ahead and applied that to an image from the hubble telescope. 
From there, we used sep to detect the objects in the image. We found their fluxes and  calculated the mean, median, and standard deviation of these fluxes. 

Finally, we used two more images to creat a 3-color false image using RGB. 

Thanks to the profs and TA for the class :D
